# Immigration in the US: Udacity Data Engineering Capstone Project

### Project Summary

The US National Tourism and Trade Office provides a database of reports on the Visitor Arrivals Program (I-94 Record). Each report contains international visitor arrival statistics by world regions and select countries (including top 20), type of visa, mode of transportation, age groups, states visited (first intended address only), and the top ports of entry (for select countries). Data sources include: Overseas DHS/CBP I-94 Program data; Canadian visitation data (Stats Canada) and Mexican visitation data (Banco de Mexico) (source: https://travel.trade.gov/research/reports/i94/historical/2016.html).

The goal of this project is to build an ETL pipeline using the above plus supplementary sources (temperature, city demographics, airport codes) in order to build a database that can be used to derive insights on immigration patterns to the US. These insights include, but are not limited to:

* location where most visitors are coming from
* location where most visitors are headed to
* if temperature, city demographics, etc. are a factor in destination

The project follows the follow steps:
* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
* Step 3: Define the Data Model
* Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data
* Step 5: Complete Project Write Up
